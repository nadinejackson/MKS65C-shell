-Implement simple redirection using > (redirecting stdout) and < (redirecting stdin) 
-Implement simple pipes, that is: ls | wc would run ls and use the output from ls as the input for wc. - Check out popen() for this. 

Every function you write must have a function header describing the arguments, return value and what the function does.

You should have a readme file with the following:
-A description of what features your shell implements
-A description of what features you attempted to implement but were unsuccessful
-Any bugs or things you want me to know about your program
-I am much more forgiving of reported bugs than bugs I discover while testing
-A copy of every function header
-An example of the readme file can be found in the github repository for this assignment
-This project should use separate C files as necessary.

Try starting with these restrictions on input:
-You can restrict the locations and ordering of > and <.
